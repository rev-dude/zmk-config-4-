Rollow is one of the first split keyboards with dedicated thumb encoders... It's inspired by the ergonomics of a Ferris and the elegance of a Corne. While also influenced by my passion for the automotive customization scene.

This passion is represented in the small details likeâ€¦

- A base plate designed with hot-swap socket cutouts, allowing sockets to fit within the plate making Rollow one of the lowest sitting hot-swappable split keyboards (Excluding Mini Version).
- Custom Inset OLED covers add additional protection to your OLEDs, while maintaining a balanced, sleek, and flush appearance to your board.
- Gasket-like sound dampening layer to minimize unwanted rattles and noise.
```

My Notes:

- This is my first time using ZMK and Github Actions. Please bear with me
- My keymap is heavily inspired by Manna Harbor Miryoku. I flipped some things around and made some operations doable with the left side so I can keep using the mouse

- ZMK does not officially define the Rollow Shield and does not support Peripheral Side Encoder as of 2023-01-18
  - Uses [GitHub - nickconway/zmk: ZMK Firmware Repository](https://github.com/nickconway/zmk) dev branch to enable peripheral side encoder and mouse support
  - Leveraged [tutuuXY](https://github.com/TutuuXY/zmk-config)'s repo to get shield definition
  - My [Issues](https://github.com/T4CORUN/zmk-config/issues)
